# Python-Card-Game
This project is a command-line-based two-player card game implemented in Python. It includes user authentication (sign-up and login), a deck-shuffling mechanism, and a game logic system that determines the winner based on card colors and values. The game maintains a scoreboard and allows for multiple rounds with new players.
